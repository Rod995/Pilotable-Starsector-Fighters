# Pilotable Starsector Fighters

 * *HowCanSomeoneLetaGoodThingGotoWaste* is a Starsector mod that makes fighters pilotable, even modded ones.
On the other hand, it doesn't support vanilla at all.

## Currently Supported:

Mod Name | Completion Level | Bugs? | Deviations 
-------- | ---------------- | ----- | ----------
Diable Avionics | 90% | [II], [III] | [A]
Dassault-Mikoyan | 40% | [III] | NaN

### Current Bugs:
 
 [II] - Blizzaia is basically useless, as it has nothing but missiles, and one IBIS.
 
 [III] - All fighters cost over 50-60 supplies just to fix, starting from 0% CR.

 [IV] - Can't ever build the ships, as they will consume all your capacity instead. Dunno if fixed by commit f958bac.
 

### Deviations:

 [A] - Blizzaia + adds a missile autoloader, and *technically* fixes [2]. Problem is that it murders everything.


### Fixed Bugs:

 [I] - `Zephyr will crash with a null error due to missing weapons, either side. Will attempt to remedy this by separating its arms from its weapons.` 99% fixed as of commit 80a92a1. 


## How to use custom Jars?

* Diable Avionics - Dump the jar in the root folder of the Diable mod folder. Replace the `mod_info.json` with the one in the folder as well. Make sure to backup, just in case. ~~or just reinstall the mod~~
