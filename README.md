## Pilotable Starsector Fighters

*HowCanSomeoneLetaGoodThingGotoWaste* is a Starsector mod that makes fighters pilotable, even modded ones.
On the other hand, it doesn't support vanilla at all.

### Currently Supported:

Mod Name | Completion Level | Bugs?
-------- | ---------------- | -----
Diable Avionics | 90% | [1], [2]
Dassault-Mikoyan | 40% | NaN

### Current Bugs:

 [1] - Zephyr will crash with a null error due to missing weapons, either side. Will attempt to remedy this by separating its arms from its weapons.
 
 [2] - Blizzaia is basically useless, as it has nothing but missiles, and one IBIS.
