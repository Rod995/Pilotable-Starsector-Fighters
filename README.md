### Current Bugs:
 
 [II] - Blizzaia is basically useless, as it has nothing but missiles, and one IBIS.
 
 [III] - All fighters cost over 50-60 supplies just to fix, starting from 0% CR.

 [IV] - Can't ever build the ships, as they will consume all your capacity instead. Dunno if fixed by commit f958bac.
 

### Deviations:

 [A] - Blizzaia + adds a missile autoloader, and *technically* fixes [II]. Problem is that it murders everything.
 
 [B] - The Foil Bit, the tiniest thingie, is somehow one of the ***strongest*** single ship fighters in that part of the mod currently. Can even solo some small frigates, as long as there's no beams in play. No fighter can stand against beams.


### Fixed Bugs:

 [I] - `Zephyr will crash with a null error due to missing weapons, either side. Will attempt to remedy this by separating its arms from its weapons.` 99% fixed as of commit 80a92a1. 


## How to install custom Jars?

* Diable Avionics - Dump the jar in the root folder of the Diable mod folder. Replace the `mod_info.json` with the one in the folder as well. Make sure to backup, just in case. ~~or just reinstall the mod~~ 

## Balance?

* OP is determined by multiplying the `wing_data.csv` value `op cost` by 3?
Probably gonna make a proper formula later.
