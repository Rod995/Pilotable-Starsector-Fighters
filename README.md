# Pilotable Starsector Fighters

 * *HowCanSomeoneLetaGoodThingGotoWaste* is a Starsector mod that makes fighters pilotable, even modded ones.
On the other hand, it doesn't support vanilla at all.

## Currently Supported:

Mod Name | Completion Level | Bugs? | Deviations 
-------- | ---------------- | ----- | ----------
Diable Avionics | 90% | [I], [II], [III] | [A]
Dassault-Mikoyan | 40% | [III] | NaN

### Current Bugs:

 [I] - Zephyr will crash with a null error due to missing weapons, either side. Will attempt to remedy this by separating its arms from its weapons.
 
 [II] - Blizzaia is basically useless, as it has nothing but missiles, and one IBIS.
 
 [III] - All fighters cost over 50-60 supplies just to fix, starting from 0% CR.
 
 

### Deviations:

 [A] - Blizzaia + adds a missile autoloader, and *technically* fixes [2]. Problem is that it murders everything.
