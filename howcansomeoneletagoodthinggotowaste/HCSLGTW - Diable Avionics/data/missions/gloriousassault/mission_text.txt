     Far, far into the future...
     There's lots of fun! 

     Join Chaplain Hendricks as he engages in the biggest, most unrealistically unbalanced  
combat situations of this side of the Sector! Many people have died! Many people will die! Not really, they'll be fine with a good bit of rest afterwards. Can't say much about the people who bet on these, though... 

     Anyway, first up we have a few wanzers to get rid of, since they were scrap heaps and make pretty explosions when they're "removed."

     A generous warm up!
